	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:20px">Our <strong>motto</strong> is <em>आनोभद्राःक्रतवोयन्तुविश्वतः</em> [Aa no bhadrahkratavoyantuvishwatah] which is a shloka from the Rig-Veda giving the universal and perennial message- &ldquo;<em>May auspicious thoughts come to us from all over the world&rdquo;. </em>In the present stage of education, transcending narrow boundaries of culture and continents, this message becomes all the more relevant as embracing ideas from all directions is an auspicious endeavor that elevates the self and the society by striving towards peace, knowledge and harmony.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:20px">Our <strong>vision</strong> is to dispel the darkness prevailing in our society and we have therefore earmarked a campaign named <strong>&lsquo;Vision Transformation&rsquo;</strong>. Under this campaign, we impart basic education to children with insufficient means and spread awareness about the importance of education. Besides imparting education, we provide them free study materials, school uniforms, bags, etc. and above all, emotional support and hope.</span></p>
