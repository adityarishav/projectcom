	<p style="font-size: 25px;">Dr. G.L. Dutta DAV Public School, Kankarbagh,</strong>at MauryaVihar Colony, Transport Nagar, Patnawas founded on <strong>11<sup>th</sup> May, 1998</strong>to carry forward the torch of knowledge and brilliance of the globally acclaimed D.A.V. group of institutions. It is an English medium co-educational institution running under experienced and qualified management and faculty who endeavor to spread the aroma of the unique DAV experience to the biggest colony of Asia, here in Patna. &nbsp;Needless to say, this noble mission has blessed this institution in rising from its humble beginnings to now proudly towering&nbsp; as a premier institution worth emulating.<br><p style="font-size: 20px;">The school has its 10+2 affiliation from <strong>C.B.S.E. New Delhi</strong> and is managed by DAV College Managing Committee, New Delhi which has been instrumental in providing diagnostic assessment and smart curriculum content for teachers, as well as independent learning resource platforms for students. Our students excel in all spheres of scholastic and co-scholastic activities bearing testimony to the personalized approach of our school towards their holistic development. 100% results in Board examinations from the beginning and a high percentage of 10 CGPA scorers are a healthy indicator to the upward trajectory this school is bound to scale with each passing year. Moreover, the dedication and performance of our students in the field of sports, National and International Science &amp; Cyber Olympiads have earned us recognition from regional, national as well as global quarters.&nbsp;The spacious campus is laid out in 2. &frac14; &nbsp;acres of land along the banks of River Ganges. It is just 1 Km from the <em>NH19 Chhapra-Patna Highway</em> which connects to the <em>Mahatma Gandhi Setu</em>.&nbsp; Patna was at the confluence of some of the&nbsp; most culturally developed civilizations of India&rsquo;s glorious past. In the lap of this ancient city, we bring together a profound harmony of moral values and scientific inspiration through our teaching medium. Let knowledge come to us from all directions and let us together bask in its radiance and dispel all forms of ignorance.</p></p>
